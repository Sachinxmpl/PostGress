ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping, a programming technique used in software development to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. This technique creates a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language.

ORMs let you easily interact with your database without worrying too much about the underlying syntax (SQL language for eg)



### WHY ORMS 
- simple syntax to write queries 
- abstraction that lests you filp the database , prisma orm can be used with mongoDB , mysql etc.
- type safety and ease of autocompletion 

### Some 4 pitch words of prisma
1 Database migration
